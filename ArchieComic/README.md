The fact that my city does not have good comic outlets is frustrating. So, like most people I was searching for a few copies of Archie Comic that were made free by the publishers.
I did find a website (which I don't believe is by the publishers), but I found one nonetheless.

The thing about the comics was that:
(a) the images could not be downloaded
(b) I had to zoom in everytime because of browser problems
(c) there were too many pages in too many issues
(d) clicking next for a new page to load was both time-consuming and irritating




This Python Script deals with the repeated task of flipping the page by downloading the image and saving it into a PDF, because:
(a) PDFs are easier to read
(b) Offline access
(c) Continuous flow



ISSUES:

Since this was my first Python Project, I did not pay much attention to it. Issues include:
(a) Manually feeding in the total page numbers for a particular issue
(b) Manually modifying the image-URL
(c) First page of PDF remains blank
(d) Size of the PDF + Image mismatch
